There are some .png blank files that you will need in order foe the popup to work.  
The ones without _tp(transparent) at the end are used for sizing where you want it to be interactive with touch.
After you size it, replace it with the same file but with _tp(transparent) at the end.  

Be mindful where to place your code in picture elements.  Placement depends on whether one object will work before the other.
